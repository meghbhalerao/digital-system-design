# Digital System Design 
## Brief Description 
This repository contains the codes for [EE311](https://eee.nitk.ac.in/course/digital-system-design-ee311) **Digital System Design** course at NITK. 
## Steps to run the codes
Please navigate to the individual folders to take a look at the content. The file `./programs/reduce.py` contains a small example of program for logic reduction using **K-maps**. The `./programs/simplify.js` contains the javascipt code to synthesize a minimum **Programmable Logic Array (PLA)**, using the well known [espresso algorithm](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse467/98au/espresso/espresso.html). 
## Dependencies
### python
- [`logicmin`](https://pypi.org/project/logicmin/)
